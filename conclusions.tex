\section{Conclusions}

We have described all development of our robot Judith. We believe that all of these tasks can help on home, health and office services. To improve the acceptance of these robots, we have been working into a behavior analysis framework developed using ROS. With this framework, we intend to:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Identifying people's emotion;
    \item Creating user behavior profile;
    \item Improving approach to start a interaction.
\end{itemize}

With this TDP, we hope to participate on Robocup 2016 in Germany and try to advance during the competition and learn with all teams, as we did to reach third place on XIV Latin American Robotic Competition in 2015.
