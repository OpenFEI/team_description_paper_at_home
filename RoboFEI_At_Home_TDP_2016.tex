\begin{abstract}
This paper presents the description of the RoboFEI@Home team as it stands for the Robocup 2016 in Leipzig, Germany. It describes all mechanical, electrical and software modules, designed for RoboFEI's robot, which is called Judith, a robot based on Peoplebot platform. Judith was built to attempt Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) on social scenarios, which is the main research of our team. A framework for behavior analysis and adaptation have been constructed in the last year to be implement on Judith and many other robots.
